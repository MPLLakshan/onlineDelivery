#  Security & Compliance - AutoPilotOps

This document outlines how AutoPilotOps protects user data and ensures compliance with privacy regulations.

##  1. Data Protection & Access Control

###  HTTPS Everywhere
- All frontend/backend communication uses HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)
- Auto-enabled via Render (or Firebase/Cloudflare)

###  Authentication & Authorization
- Firebase Auth is used for secure login (OAuth, Email/Password)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is planned for admin-level features

###  Data Encryption
- Data in transit is encrypted via HTTPS
- Data at rest (user info/logs) encrypted by default via Firebase/Supabase
- API keys and secrets are stored in environment variables (not in code)

##  2. GDPR & Legal Compliance

###  Data Collection & Consent
- Users are informed about data usage
- Only essential data is collected (email, usage logs, deployment activity)
- Cookie consent banner for analytics (if used)

###  Right to Access / Delete
- Users can request data access/export via email
- Accounts and related data can be deleted upon request

###  Hosting Location
- Render/Firebase allows hosting in specific regions (ex: EU if needed)
- We plan to store data in compliance with user location (future)

##  3. Monitoring & Audit

###  Audit Logs (Future)
- Deployment activity logs for admin review
- Alerting system via LogSnag

###  Breach Response
- Incident response plan (in draft)
- Notify users of any breaches within 72 hours

##  Planned Improvements

- Add RBAC (admin/developer roles)
- Add 2FA for login
- Store logs with retention policy
