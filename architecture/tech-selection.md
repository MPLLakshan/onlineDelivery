#  Technology Stack Selection & Justification - AutoPilotOps

##  Overview

We chose our tech stack by evaluating **scalability**, **ease of maintenance**, **community support**, and **cost efficiency**. Below is a breakdown of each key layer in the system.

---

##  Frontend: **React.js**

- Modern, component-based UI framework
- Huge community and ecosystem
- Easy to integrate with APIs and monitoring dashboards
- Lightweight and responsive for SPAs

 Easy to maintain  
 Fast rendering  
 Free & open-source

---

##  Backend: **Node.js + Express**

- Lightweight and fast for building APIs
- Non-blocking I/O â€” ideal for async tasks (pipelines, logs)
- Massive ecosystem (NPM)
- Developer-friendly for both frontend/backend devs

 Scalable (stateless)  
 Low dev onboarding time  
 Well-documented

---

##  Cloud Provider: **Render.com**

- Heroku-like simplicity with auto-scaling
- Cheaper than AWS for MVP stage
- Free tier for small services
- GitHub integration for CI/CD

 Zero DevOps overhead  
 Autoscaling & deploy hooks  
 Free TLS/SSL & CDN

---

##  Auth & User Management: **Firebase Auth**

- Email/password, Google, GitHub login ready-made
- No need to build custom auth system
- Secure & scalable
- Well-documented with SDKs

 Saves weeks of development  
 Works with web & mobile  
 Scales easily

---

##  Monitoring: **LogSnag + UptimeRobot**

- Real-time deploy logs and alerts (LogSnag)
- Ping monitoring for uptime (UptimeRobot)
- Cost-effective with free tiers

 Instant alerting  
 No complex setup  
 Slack/email integrations

---

##  (Optional) Database: **PostgreSQL (via Supabase)**

- Only if user data or history needed in later stages
- Supabase gives real-time + auth + storage
- SQL support and scalable schema

 Free for MVP  
 Realtime features  
 Hosted + easy dashboard
